We employ and develop cutting-edge tools to record\rand manipulate neuronal and molecular activities to unravel neural mechanisms underlying\rmemory processes. Our integrative approach combines electrophysiology, imaging, behavior,\rgenetic manipulations, omics, and computational modeling.\rThe major tools used in the lab include in vivo electrophysiology, two-photon calcium imaging,\rone-photon endoscopic imaging, fiber photometry, opto-/chemo-genetic manipulations, and ex\rvivo electrophysiology. We also actively develop our own tools to address specific scientific\rquestions through bioengineering, chemical synthesis, (nano)materials engineering, and\relectrical engineering.\rElucidating neural networks supporting memory encoding and consolidation\rSee how we identified a hypothalamic novelty hub and how it modulates different types of memories in the hippocampus.\rMuch of our work focuses on the hippocampus, a brain region giving rise to neural sequences\runderlying episodic memory. These sequences, occurring during both behavior (e.g. theta\rsequences) and sleep (e.g. replay sequences), lay the foundation for memory encoding and\rconsolidation. We believe what drives these sequences is a brain-wide oscillation network, and\rour lab is elucidating the key nodes in this network and how information is transmitted and\rcomputed among them.\rOne recent focus of the lab is an understudied subcortical structure in the brain’s oscillation\rnetwork, the supramammillary nucleus (SuM). This small hypothalamic nucleus is unique in its\rbroad, extensive connections to the hippocampus and cortex. We are investigating how these\rlong-range, bottom-up pathways modulate network dynamics to process memory.\rThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem\rto support it.\rWhole-brain mapping of SuM projections by clearing.\rSuM soma (top) and axons in the hippocampus (bottom).\rOptogenetic identification and recording of DG- (top) and CA2-(bottom) projecting SuM neurons during behavior.\rDeciphering neural computation underlying memory-guided behavior\rComplex cognitive activities, such as thinking and planning, rely on established knowledge\rabout the external world. We believe that through elaborately designed behavioral tasks\rcombined with large-scale in vivo recordings of neural activity, we may probe the underlying\rneural computation mechanisms.\rOur lab employs this approach to investigate how the brain synthesizes novel ideas and solutions\rfrom stored information–i.e. memory retrieval and utilization. By drawing inspiration from\rpsychology, engineering, and computer sciences, we aim to dissect neural computational\rmechanisms underlying memory-guided complex behaviors.\rThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem\rto support it.\rGoal-directed spatial navigation in T-maze.\rDeveloping next-generation, noninvasive brain machine interfaces for memory and cognitive control\rSee how we developed and showcased a minimally invasive technology, near-infrared upconversion optogenetics, for various neuromodulation applications, e.g. recalling an episodic memory by transcranial NIR light.\rManipulating memory and cognition requires technologies to spatiotemporally modulate nervous\rsystems in deep tissue, sometimes in a precision closed-loop manner. For decades, physicians\rhave utilized implanted electrodes connected through wires to a pacemaker-like device under the\rskin of the chest to electrically stimulate neurons deep in the brain. This approach, known as\rdeep brain stimulation, has proven to be effective, but is costly, highly invasive, and lacks cell\rspecificity.\rOur lab is developing noninvasive, high-precision neuromodulation technologies to manipulate\rdiverse deep structures in the nervous system that are conventionally hard and intrusive to reach.\rWe adopt a cross-disciplinary approach by designing and synthesizing molecularly engineered,\rnoninvasively delivered nano- or micro-interfaces capable of converting tissue-penetrable stimuli\rinto signals recognized/sensible by genetically defined cells. We believe such efforts will\rcontribute to the field’s collective efforts in unlocking diverse routes towards next-generation,\rnoninvasive neuromodulation therapies.\rNear-infrared optogenetics mediated by upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs).\rElectron micrographs of UCNPs distributed in tissue (top). Reactivation of hippocampal engram (green) by UCNPs (blue).\rThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem\rto support it.\rReal-time imaging of retrograde axonal transport of UCNPs.\rLinking molecular and network pathologies of Alzheimer’s disease\rSee how we demonstrated the efficacy of a peptide drug that rescues synaptic function and cognitive function in a mouse model of advanced-stage AD.\rAlzheimer\u0026#39;s disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly. There is\rcurrently no cure for AD, and clinical trials only provide modest benefits.\rWhile characterized by pathological molecules like amyloid-β, tau and APOE4, AD is a mental\rand cognitive disorder. How the molecular pathologies of AD lead to cognitive decline remains\relusive. Bridging this gap requires understanding neural circuit mechanisms. By leveraging our\rexpertise in systems neuroscience, our lab is identifying circuit pathophysiology of AD by using\ranimal models of different pathologies.\rOnce elucidated, circuit mechanisms of AD could be employed to develop next-generation,\rcircuit-targeted therapies to restore memory and cognition. Individualized, circuit-oriented\rdiagnosis and treatment may become possible with time.\rThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem\rto support it.\rIn vivo calcium imaging to probe hippocampal neural dynamics in the AD brain.\r(top) In vitro electrophysiology to measure drug-modified synaptic plasticity.\r(bottom) Laser capture microdissection of CA1 cell bodies for localized proteomics.\r","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"Our lab’s research focuses on elucidating how memory is encoded, retained, and retrieved within\rneural networks and molecules in the brain.
