We employ and develop cutting-edge tools to record and manipulate neuronal and molecular activities to unravel these mysteries.\rOur approach is integrative, expanding from electrophysiology, imaging, behavior, genetic manipulations, omics, to computational modeling.\rElucidating neural networks supporting memory encoding and consolidation\rSee how we identified a hypothalamic novelty hub and how it modulates different types of memories in the hippocampus.\rMuch of our work focuses on the hippocampus, a brain region giving rise to neural sequences underlying episodic memory. These sequences, occurring during either behavior (e.g. theta sequences) or sleep (e.g. replay sequences), lay the foundation of memory encoding and consolidation. We believe what drives these sequences is a brain-wide oscillation network, and our lab is elucidating the key nodes in this network and how information is transmitted and computed among them.\rOne recent focus of the lab is an understudied subcortical structure in the brain’s oscillation network, the supramammillary nucleus (SuM). Unique about this small hypothalamic nucleus is its broad, extensive connections to the hippocampus and cortex. We are investigating how these long-range bottom-up pathways modulate network dynamics to process memory.\rThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem\rto support it.\rWhole-brain mapping of SuM projections by clearing.\rSuM soma (top) and axons in the hippocampus (bottom).\rOptogenetic identification and recording of DG- (top) and CA2-(bottom) projecting SuM neurons during behavior\rDeciphering neural computation underlying memory-guided behavior\rComplex cognitive activities, such as thinking and planning, rely on established knowledge about the external world. We believe that by elaborately designed behavioral tasks, combined with large-scale in vivo recordings of neural activity, we may probe the underlying neural computation mechanisms. Our lab employs this approach to investigate how the brain synthesizes novel ideas and solutions from stored information – i.e. memory retrieval and utilization. By drawing inspiration from psychology, engineering, and computer sciences, we aim to dissect neural computational mechanisms underlying memory-guided complex behaviors.\rThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem\rto support it.\rGoal-directed spatial navigation in T-maze\rDeveloping next-generation noninvasive brain machine interfaces for memory and cognitive control\rSee how we developed and showcased a minimally invasive technology, “near-infrared upconversion optogenetics”, for various neuromodulation applications, e.g. recalling an episodic memory by transcranial NIR light.\rManipulating memory and cognition requires technologies to spatiotemporally modulate nervous systems in deep tissue, sometimes in a precision closed-loop manner. For decades, physicians have utilized implanted electrodes connected through wires to a pacemaker-like device under the skin of the chest to electrically stimulate neurons deep in the brain. This approach, known as deep brain stimulation, has proved to be effective, but is costly, highly invasive, and lacks cell specificity.\rOur lab is developing noninvasive, high-precision neuromodulation technologies to manipulate diverse deep structures in the nervous system that are conventionally hard and intrusive to reach. We adopt a cross\rdisciplinary approach by designing and synthesizing molecularly engineered, noninvasively delivered nano- or micro-interfaces capable of converting tissue-penetrable stimuli into signals sensible by genetically defined cells. We believe such efforts will contribute to the field’s collective efforts in unlocking diverse routes towards next-generation, noninvasive neuromodulation therapies.\rNear-infrared optogenetics mediated by upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs).\rElectron micrographs of UCNPs distributed in tissue (top). UCNPs (blue) activates hippocampal engram (green)\rThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem\rto support it.\rReal-time imaging of retrograde axonal transport of UCNPs.\rLinking molecular and network pathologies of Alzheimer’s disease\rSee how we demonstrated the efficacy of a peptide drug that rescues synaptic function and cognitive function in a mouse model of advanced-stage AD\rAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly. There is currently no cure for AD, and clinical trials only provide modest benefits. While characterized by pathological molecules like amyloid-β, tau and APOE4, AD is a mental and cognitive disorder. How the molecular pathologies of AD lead to cognitive decline remains elusive. Bridging this gap requires understanding neural circuit mechanisms. By leveraging our expertise in systems neuroscience, our lab is identifying circuit pathophysiology of AD by using animal models of different pathologies. Once elucidated, circuit mechanisms of AD could be employed to develop next-generation, circuit-targeted therapies to restore memory and cognition. Individualized, circuit\roriented diagnosis and treatment may become possible with time\rThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem\rto support it.\rIn vivo calcium imaging to probe hippocampal neural dynamics in the AD brain.\rIn vitro electrophysiology to measure drug-modified synaptic transmission and plasticity.\rLaser capture microdissection of hippocampal neurons for localized proteomics.\r","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"Our lab’s research focuses on elucidating how memory is encoded, retained, and retrieved within neural networks and molecules in the brain.
